1. To run the code, you must first install lp_solve 5.5 (http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/) and Java wrapper. Make sure that they are in the right place and can be found by the Java program. "lib/lpsolve55j.jar" is the lp_solve 5.5 java library.

2. Type 'ant' to build the code and type 'ant run' to run the algorithm on the Box-Pushing problme.

3. You can test other problems by changing the problemId in the main function of "src/DecTBDP.java". 

4. The Ids of all available benchmark problems can be found in "src/ProblemDataSmall.java".

5. If you use the code in your publication, please cite the following paper:

   Feng Wu, Shlomo Zilberstein, Xiaoping Chen. Trial-Based Dynamic Programming for Multi-Agent Planning. 
   Proceedings of the 24th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), Page 908-914, Atlanta, United States, 2010.

Enjoy it!
